-- 1.3.0 Minimal use from relatively natural environments

-- This class includes land that is subject to relatively low levels of intervention or that is largely unused in the context of prime use or use for resource protection. This land may be covered with indigenous or exotic plant species. It includes land where the structure of the native vegetation generally remains intact despite deliberate use, although the floristics of the vegetation may have changed markedly (e.g. grazing on native tussock land).

-- Where native grasses have been deliberately and extensively replaced with other species, the land use should not be classified under class 1.

-- 1.3.6 Defence land â€“ natural areas allocated to field training, weapons testing, and other field defence uses, predominantly in rural areas (e.g. Kaipara Air Weapons Range and the Waiouru Military Camp). Areas associated with buildings or more built environments on defence land are captured under an urban class.
